The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2d shapes and bitmap images. It is a canvas particle with simple animation. Canvas allows us to the drawable region on your screen. But is diffrent from SVG. Some anticipated uses of canvas include building graphs, animations, games, and image composition.
